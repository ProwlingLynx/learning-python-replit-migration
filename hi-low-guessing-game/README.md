# Hi Lo guessing game
## Introduction
This is the day 12 project in the 100 days of python coding course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu.

The intended game is a series of console prints where the user is able to input guesses to identify a random number between 1 and 100. The app has an easy and hard mode, where easy gives the user 10 chances to guess and hard gives 5.
## Number Guessing Game Objectives:
 - Include an ASCII art logo.
 - Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
 - Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer. 
 - If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
 - Track the number of turns remaining.
 - If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player. 
 - Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only - 5 guesses in hard mode).
